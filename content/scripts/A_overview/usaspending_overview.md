# USA Spending

## Brief Overview

The USA Spending API provides programmatic access to comprehensive U.S. government spending data, including spending on awards (e.g., federal contracts, grants, geographic breakdowns, agency breakdowns) and account-level, non-award spending such as federal employee compensation. The API is currently in V2, with V1 endpoints being deprecated. No registration is required to use the API. Visit the USA Spending API documentation for information on getting started, available endpoints, and background information[^1].
