# Brief Overview

The U.S. Census Bureau offers several APIs for accessing census data and
related information. Registration is not required, but registering
allows more queries and features[^1]. See the U.S. Census Data API User
Guide[^2] and Terms of Service[^3] for specific information about API
policies, data reuse, and allowed use-cases.
